Pintos is an instructional operating system created at the Stanford University by Ben Pfaff in 2004.  Pintos originated as a replacement for Nachos, a similar system originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley by Tom Anderson, and was designed along similar lines.

Pintos was developed with an intention to introduce undergraduate students to concepts in operating system design and implementation by requiring them to implement significant portions of a real operating system, including thread, memory management and file system.

This work involves transformation of the primitive Pintos kernel into a modern UNIX-like kernel called Burritos.  Throughout the process of transformation “from Pintos to Burritos”, we have strengthened Pintos’s support in three key areas – process, memory and file management, which has taken us to a level of understanding that merely reading the code couldn’t have provided.

This experience was a great opportunity for us not only to develop a modern kernel, but also to get a taste of what it takes to develop large scale hardware and software development projects.
